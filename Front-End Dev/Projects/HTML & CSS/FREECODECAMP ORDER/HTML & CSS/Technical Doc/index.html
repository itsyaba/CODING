                    <p id="para1">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
                    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                    programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <div class="brake"></div>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                        (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user
                        events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
                        example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p></li>

                        <h3>JavaScript and Java</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p id="para3">
                            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
                            resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
                            syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                            JavaScript.</p>
                                        <div class="brake"></div>
                            <p>  In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
                            on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
                            object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
                            special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                                        <div class="brake"></div>
                        <p> JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
                            methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
                            implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
